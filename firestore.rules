     * AI Synapse Security Rules
     * 
     * CORE PHILOSOPHY:
     * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model. User profiles and custom content sources 
     * follow a strict ownership model (Path-based or Attribute-based), while global content 
     * sources and aggregated content items are publicly accessible to ensure a seamless 
     * discovery experience.
     * 
     * DATA STRUCTURE:
     * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles.
     * - /sources/{sourceId}: A shared collection containing both system-managed (global) 
     *   sources and user-defined custom RSS feeds.
     * - /contentItems/{contentItemId}: A public repository of all aggregated articles.
     * 
     * KEY SECURITY DECISIONS:
     * 1. Denormalization for Authorization: Custom 'Source' documents include a 'userId' 
     *    field. This allows rules to verify ownership directly on the document without 
     *    expensive cross-document lookups.
     * 2. Anonymous Support: Rules are designed to support both 'password' and 'anonymous' 
     *    authentication providers as specified in the backend requirements.
     * 3. Write Protection: Only the system (via Administrative SDKs) or the specific 
     *    owner can modify data. Public write access is strictly forbidden.
     * 
     * DEPLOYMENT NOTE: 
     * The reported error 'auth/operation-not-allowed' typically indicates that 'Anonymous' 
     * or 'Email/Password' authentication is not enabled in the Firebase Console. 
     * Please ensure these providers are toggled 'ON' in the Authentication > Sign-in method tab.
